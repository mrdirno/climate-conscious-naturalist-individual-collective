### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character discovers a 'Node Steward' from the Ark project in their local woodland, struggling with the reality of the ecosystem versus the algorithm's instructions.
- Create a journal entry from Mara's perspective, detailing a specific sonic change in the forest's dawn chorus over a five-year period, and what she believes it means.
- Imagine a confrontation between Elias and a developer for a 'climate retreat' bunker community. The developer argues they are also adapting to survive. Write their dialogue.
- Write a folktale or myth that a future society might tell about 'The Chroniclers,' weaving their meticulous recordings into a legend of remembrance.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a 'Phenology Kit' for citizen scientists inspired by Elias's methods: low-tech, durable tools for observing and recording seasonal changes in a local ecosystem.
- Prototype a conceptual interface for the 'Global Climate Ark Project' AI, showing how it selects 'node' locations and communicates with its stewards. What data does it prioritize, and what does it miss?
